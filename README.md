[BASICS]

The Sugar Phosphate "Backbone" is a semiconductor similar to a circut board.

Sugar groups are used as circuit trace and solder material for bases.

Bases (Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine) are used as organic resistors in strands of organic circuit.

Calculating the resistance of each base can be used to read "code" within strands of DNA.



[GEOMETRY OF DNA AND ELECTRON FLOW]

Electrons travel rapidly through dna strands generating an electromagnetic field as in a copper wire.

Sugar carries the electron through pairs of bases through the ladder creating a electromagnetic field.

The electric field follows coulombs force and the right hand rule of magnetic force on a moving electron.

The right hand force of traveling electrons is responsible for the trademark spiral seen in DNA as the force literally warps the "ladder" during electron transfer.
