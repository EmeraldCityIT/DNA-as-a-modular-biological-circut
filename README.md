[BASICS]

The Sugar Phosphate "Backbone" as a p-type semiconductor.

Sugar groups are used as circuit trace and solder material for Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine.

Bases are used as resistors in strands of organic circuit.

Calculating the resistance of each base can be used to read "code" within strands of DNA.


[GEOMETRY OF DNA AND ELECTRON FLOW]

Electrons travel rapidly through dna strands generating an electromagnetic field as in a copper wire.

Electric field follows coulombs force and the right hand rule of magnetic force on a moving electron.

The right hand force of traveling electrons are responsible for the trademark spiral seen in DNA.
