The exact speed at which an electron will travel through a length of DNA 

is determined by arrangement of nucleobases along series of codon.

Each Codon has 64 possible patterns.

Amino acids and proteins within the body are bioregenerative base 64 circuit boards.

This project intends to convert DNA sequencing into hexidecimal format for further research in biomechanics.
