The exact speed at which an electron will travel through a length of DNA is determined by the arrangement of nucleobases along the path.
Each Codon has 64 possible patterns. Amino acids and proteins within the body are bioregenerative base 64 hexidecimal circuit boards. This project intends to convert DNA sequencing into hexidecimal format for further research in biomechanics.
